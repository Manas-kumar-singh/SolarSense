## Introduction

Solar radiation prediction is crucial for various applications, including solar energy generation and climate modeling. This project uses quantum computing techniques to predict solar radiation based on features such as temperature, pressure, wind speed, the day of the year, and hour of the day.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need to have Python 3.x installed along with the following packages:

- `pennylane`
- `tensorflow`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pennylane tensorflow numpy scikit-learn
